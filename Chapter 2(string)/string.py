#String 
name = "rayyan"
# # Now we learn the slicing of the string
# print (name)
# shortName=name[0:3]
# print(shortName)
# # various senario in slicing 
# print(name[:3] )# herer we take slicing as name[0:3]
# print(name[1:])# we take name[0:len-1]

# Negative slicing 
# print(name[-4:-1])
# # in negative slicing we have convert to postive indexes
# print(name[1:4])
